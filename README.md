# R Magic

This is a collection of R scripts from Dr. Ray Nelson's stats and forecasting classes at Brigham Young University (MBA 609 and PMGT 634).

Feel free to fork the repository and add your own scripts (send me push requests as needed). If git isn't your thing, e-mail me any scripts or corrections.
